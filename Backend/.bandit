# Skip certain tests that are expected in a security scanner tool
skips = B404,B603,B607,B108

# Configuration explanation:
# B404: subprocess import needed for running security tools
# B603: subprocess without shell=True is safer than shell=True  
# B607: partial path for git/npm commands expected in PATH
# B108: hardcoded temp directory in tests is acceptable for testing
